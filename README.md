# ITS CALCULATOR TIME!
## By Eddie Li

I will be developing a Graphic Calculator on processing with some more advanced features so that it would be a viable application for the curriculum past seconday math 2. The standard calculator only has the potential for basic calculations so I plan on adding other functions to solve sohcahtoa and factorials. I also want to add a game function to reference calculators that can play games if possible.
