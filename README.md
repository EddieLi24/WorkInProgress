# ITS CALCULATOR TIME!
## By Eddie Li

I will be developing a Graphic Calculator on processing with some more advanced features so that it would be a viable application for the curriculum past seconday math 2. The standard calculator only has the potential for basic calculations so I plan on adding other functions to solve sohcahtoa and factorials. I also want to add a game function to reference calculators that can play games if possible.

## Finishing Notes

I was able to use recursion to implement the factorial function on the calculator though it did take a lot of time along with sin, cos, and tan. I also includes a power function so that the user is not only limited to 2 and 3. However, I was not able to implement the gaming feature since I did not know how to connect it with the calculator (I tried a boolean). Overall, this was a good experience to test my ability on coding.
